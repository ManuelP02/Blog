# Personal Blog


## Description

This is a two-page website where users can input and view blog posts. It includes a content form, dynamic rendering of blog posts, and a light/dark mode toggle. This project aims to provide practical JavaScript experience, explore the power of the Document Object Model (DOM), and set the stage for more advanced tasks.

## User Story
As a marketing student, I want a personal blog so that I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.


## Acceptance Criteria
- When the app loads, the user is presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
- When the user submits the form, the blog post data is stored in localStorage.
- After submitting the form, the user is redirected to the posts page.
- If the user tries to submit a form without a username, title, or content, they are presented with a message prompting them to complete the form.
- On the posts page, the user is presented with a header, a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.
- When the user clicks the light mode/dark mode toggle, the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.
- When the user clicks the "Back" button, they are redirected back to the landing page where they can input more blog entries.
- In the main content area, the user is presented with a list of blog posts pulled from localStorage.
- In localStorage, the user is presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
- When the user takes a closer look at a single blog entry in the list, they can see the title, content, and author of the post.
- In the footer, the user is presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
